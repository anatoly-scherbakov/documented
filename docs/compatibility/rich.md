It's easy to write an exception with console markup or Markdown formatted text, catch that exception and `rich.print()` it for user's information.

I haven't found a way to integrate [:simple-github: rich](https://github.com/textualize/rich/) with `documented` directly, to render beautiful exceptions with console markup or Markdown text in them right in the traceback.
